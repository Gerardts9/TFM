### Easy QC:

EasyQC was applied to each original dataset obtained from the different participating cohorts, separating between X and autosomal chromosomes. AT EasyQC is the script used to apply the quality control step to the chromosome X cohorts (ARIC, GAIT2, retroveCASES, retroveCONTROLS, CHS, HVH1 and MARTHA). All the scripts used were created from the script given by the creators of the package on their website (https://www.uni-regensburg.de/medizin/epidemiologie-praeventivmedizin/genetische-epidemiologie/software/) and following the EasyQC manual (https://homepages.uni-regensburg.de/~wit59712/easyqc/EasyQC_9.0_Commands_140918_2.pdf).


### METAL Scripts

Different METAL scripts were used to meta-analyse each phenotype 


### Manhattan.R

Manhattan.R scripts were used to create the Manhattan Plots for each of the phenotypes analysed along with the table that include the significant SNPs in 1MB regions. A custom function called toptab() is used in some of them. This function takes as input the autosomal and X chromosome results from METAL, and returns a table with the significant variants plus a table to be used in the creation of Regional Plots. 


### Toptab R function

Contains the toptab() custom function used in scripts used to create Mahnattan plots and significant variants tables.


### Regional plots:

LocusZoom.R contains the script used to create the significant variants' regional plots obtained in the meta-analyses.


### Multi-phenotype:

Multi-Phenotype MPAT.R and Multi-Phenotype metaUSAT.R, are the scripts used to perform the multi-phenotype analysis of the four phenotypes (AT, PC, PST and PSF) with MPAT and metaUSAT methods, respectively. metaUSAT script includes the bash code used to apply pruning to the data before the correlation matrix obtantion.
